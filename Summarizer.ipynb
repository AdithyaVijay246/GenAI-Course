These machines can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI has a broad range of applications in various industries, including healthcare, finance, education, and transportation. Machine learning, a subset of AI, involves training algorithms to recognize patterns and make predictions based on data. With the increasing availability of big data and powerful computing resources, AI is rapidly advancing and becoming an integral part of modern life.\n",
