            "A fever itself isn't a disease, but a symptom of an underlying condition.  It's a sign that your body is fighting off something, often an infection.  Many things can cause a fever, ranging from mild to serious.\n",

            "**Possible Conditions:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Common Infections:**  Viral infections like the common cold, influenza (flu), or COVID-19 are frequent causes of fever.  Bacterial infections like strep throat, urinary tract infections (UTIs), or ear infections can also cause fever.\n",
            "* **Other Infections:**  Less common but potentially serious infections like pneumonia, meningitis, or sepsis can also present with fever.\n",
            "* **Inflammatory Conditions:**  Conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus can cause fever.\n",
            "* **Heat Exhaustion/Heat Stroke:**  Overexposure to heat can lead to a rise in body temperature.\n",
            "* **Some Medications:** Certain medications can cause fever as a side effect (drug-induced fever).\n",

            "\n",
            "* **Severity of the fever:** A low-grade fever (under 100.4°F or 38°C) in adults may not require immediate medical attention, especially if it's accompanied by mild symptoms and resolves within a few days.  However, a high fever (103°F or 39.4°C or higher) warrants prompt medical evaluation.\n",
            "* **Duration of the fever:**  A fever lasting longer than three days, even if it's not particularly high, should be checked by a doctor.\n",
            "* **Accompanying symptoms:**  If the fever is accompanied by other symptoms such as severe headache, stiff neck, difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, rash, persistent vomiting or diarrhea, or severe abdominal pain, seek immediate medical attention.  These could indicate a more serious condition.\n",
            "* **Age and overall health:** Infants, young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems are more vulnerable to complications from fever and should be seen by a doctor sooner.\n",
            "* **Recent travel or exposures:**  If you've recently traveled to an area with endemic diseases or been exposed to someone with a known infection, it's important to inform your doctor.\n",
